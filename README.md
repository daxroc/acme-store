The results of spending 30 hrs with 
* Google App Engine SDK
* Webapp2
* Bootstrap & Angular

# The API
The API is JSON centric, documentation page avaible at http://localhost:8080/api/

# The Frontend
The frontend is a single html page application built using bootstrap and angularjs. I've somewhat abused Angular as an oppertunitiy to learn more about it.
